# Openstack_ubuntu_22.04_server_multinode-

Setting up a multi-node OpenStack environment on Ubuntu requires multiple nodes to handle different components of OpenStack. The most common architecture consists of:

Controller Node – Manages services like Nova (Compute API), Neutron (Networking API), Keystone (Identity), Horizon (Dashboard), and Glance (Image service).
Compute Node(s) – Run the virtual machines (VMs) and handle the hypervisor (e.g., KVM).
Storage Node(s) (optional) – Manage block storage using services like Cinder.
Network Node – (Optional, for larger deployments) Handles Layer 3 routing and advanced networking using Open vSwitch or Linux Bridge.
In this setup, each node serves a specific role, and they communicate over a dedicated management network.

Step-by-Step Guide for Setting Up Multi-Node OpenStack on Ubuntu
Prerequisites
Hardware Requirements:

Controller Node: 8 GB RAM, 4 vCPUs, 40 GB disk.
Compute Nodes: 16 GB RAM, 4 vCPUs, 40 GB disk per node.
Dedicated management network (for internal communication).
Optional: Public network for floating IPs.
Network Setup:

Management network (internal, typically private IPs for internal OpenStack services).
Optional: External network (public IPs for accessing instances).
Ubuntu Version: Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later as the operating system for all nodes.

User Permissions: Ensure you have sudo access on all nodes.

Step 1: Install OpenStack Packages (on All Nodes)
On each node (Controller, Compute, and Network):

Enable OpenStack repository:

bash
Copy code
sudo add-apt-repository cloud-archive:wallaby
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
Install necessary packages (depending on the role):

Controller Node:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install mariadb-server rabbitmq-server memcached python3-openstackclient
Compute Node:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install nova-compute python3-openstackclient
Network Node (Optional):

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install neutron-linuxbridge-agent neutron-dhcp-agent neutron-metadata-agent
Step 2: Configure the Controller Node
MariaDB Setup:

Install and configure the database for OpenStack services:

bash
Copy code
sudo mysql_secure_installation
Create OpenStack database:

bash
Copy code
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE keystone;
CREATE DATABASE glance;
CREATE DATABASE nova;
CREATE DATABASE neutron;
RabbitMQ and Memcached Setup:

RabbitMQ acts as the message broker between services:

bash
Copy code
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user openstack password
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions openstack ".*" ".*" ".*"
Enable Memcached for caching:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/memcached.conf
Update the configuration to bind Memcached to the management network:

bash
Copy code
-l 10.0.0.11 # Replace with Controller IP
Keystone (Identity Service) Configuration:

Install Keystone:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install keystone apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
Populate the Keystone database:

bash
Copy code
sudo keystone-manage db_sync
Configure Keystone endpoints:

bash
Copy code
openstack endpoint create --region RegionOne identity public http://10.0.0.11:5000/v3
Glance (Image Service):

Install and configure Glance for managing VM images:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install glance
Populate the Glance database:

bash
Copy code
sudo glance-manage db_sync
Create an OpenStack image (optional):

bash
Copy code
openstack image create "Ubuntu 20.04" --file /path/to/image.qcow2 --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --public
Nova (Compute Service):

Install Nova on the controller node:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install nova-api nova-conductor nova-novncproxy nova-scheduler
Sync the database:

bash
Copy code
sudo nova-manage db_sync
Neutron (Networking Service):

Install Neutron for networking:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install neutron-server neutron-plugin-ml2
Configure Neutron for Layer 2 networking (Linux Bridge or Open vSwitch).

Step 3: Configure the Compute Node(s)
Install Nova on Compute Nodes:

Install the Nova compute service:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install nova-compute
Configure Nova on Compute Nodes:

Edit /etc/nova/nova.conf on each Compute node and ensure that the [api], [keystone_authtoken], and [libvirt] sections are correctly configured to connect to the Controller node.

Restart the Nova service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart nova-compute
Step 4: Configure Networking (Optional)
Install Neutron Components on the network node:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install neutron-linuxbridge-agent neutron-l3-agent neutron-dhcp-agent neutron-metadata-agent
Configure the /etc/neutron/neutron.conf and /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini files.

Restart the Neutron service:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart neutron-linuxbridge-agent
Step 5: Final Steps and Horizon (Dashboard)
Install Horizon on the controller node for a web interface:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install openstack-dashboard
Access Horizon at http://<controller-ip>/horizon.

Conclusion
This is a high-level overview of setting up a multi-node OpenStack deployment on Ubuntu. You can scale by adding more Compute and Storage nodes as needed. Each service (Nova, Neutron, Keystone, etc.) needs to be carefully configured to communicate between the Controller, Compute, and Network nodes.
